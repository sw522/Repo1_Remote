**Git Flow**

Git Flow is a collaborative tool, developed by Vincent Driessen, to be used by remote development teams to contribute and coordinate code changes in a parallel fashion, thereby yielding a workable finished product that “flows”.

Git Flow works by allowing for new development, feature development, and bug fixes to be addressed via individual branches, like swim lanes, that are clones of the main project, or repository. Each developer with a branch off the “Developer Branch” works their individual issue, and, once refined, submits it for merger into the main code.  Once accepted, or committed, , the updated code can then be pushed to, or pulled in by, other developers, who can update their local code with the changes to see what effect, if any there may be on their work effort. 

In this manner, all efforts can be assembled and sequenced regardless of time zone or geography in which the contributing developers may be. 

Once all issues are addressed and the code is fully updated on the repository, a release branch can be created, and merged with the master branch.  Ongoing development and fixes can thus be managed remotely and collaboratively.
